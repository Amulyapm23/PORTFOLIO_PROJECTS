SALES ANALYSIS

In this comprehensive sales analysis project, we delve into a dataset containing crucial information about customers, products, transactions, and markets. The project focuses on extracting valuable insights and trends from the data to guide informed business decisions.

For our analysis, we are utilising SQL to respond to the following questions from our stakeholders: 
--List the names and kinds of every customer. 
--Get the classifications of all the product codes. 
--Determine the overall sales volume and sales for each product category. 
--Count the number of transactions and the total sales for each year. 
--Calculate the average sales volume and sales volume by customer type. 
--Find the names and categories of each customer, as well as the total number of sales and the amount of sales for each. 
--Obtain the brand names, volume of sales, and dollar amount of each transaction's sales. 
--List all transactions together with the product, market, and client names. 
--Determine the total sales for each month over the course of a given year. 
--The year with the highest total sales amount.
